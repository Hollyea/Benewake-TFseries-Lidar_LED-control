# Benewake-TFseries-Lidar_LED-control
TFseries Lidar have the I/O mode(on-off mode), this demo shows how to control a LED via Arduino UNO
I/O mode means, when setting to a fixed distance.
e.g. 2m, when the actual distance is â‰¤2m, it can set to output high level(3.3V);when the actual distance is >2m, it can set to output low level(0V);
